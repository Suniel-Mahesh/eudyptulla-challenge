Response from eudyptula after finishing 20 tasks:
=================================================

Very nice job, you are now done!

If you were curious, you are the 209th person to complete the series of
tasks, with over 18000 people currently attempting it.  It's not a race,
but you've done a great job.

So, now what?

There will probably be a future round of challenge tasks, as people have
asked for them.  If you have any ideas of areas of the kernel that would
be good for tasks, or places you want there to be one, please let me
know.  If you want to be included in the next round of tasks, also let
me know.

And on the topic of feedback, anything that you might have for me to
make the whole process smoother or run better in any way would be
appreciated.  The challenge has evolved over time already due to
feedback, so it's important to get this.

Finally, if you have any questions for me about any of this, please let
me know.  You've proven that you can contribute to the kernel in a large
range of places.  If you are looking for work to do, we can always use
more developers and I'd be glad to help you find a place you can
contribute.
